# HMDA Classifer
This classifier uses the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) [dataset](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/) in order to predict whether a mortgage application will be approved.

The code walks through my process for:
- Subsetting / filtering the data
- Exploratory data analysis & visualizations
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Model selection trade-offs
